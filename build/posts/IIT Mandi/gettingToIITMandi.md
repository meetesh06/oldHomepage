### Packing for the journey
The journey through mountainous terrain is very tiring. 
As its a over night journey (from Delhi) you can also pack some **light food**; I usually just pack oranges and apples.
I recommend people who get motion sickness (or dizziness from that horrible diesel fumes) to carry **vomisel** handy (you can get it over the counter at any chemist).

There are two good options to get to IIT Mandi that I recommended.

***

## (Recommended) Option 1: Via Delhi

### 1. Which bus to book?
My only recommended bus service on this route is the government run HRTC buses, you can book the tickets online using [HRTC Official Website](https://www.hrtchp.com/hrtc_info/).
The bus starts in the evening (around 7PM) and the last bus is at 9:50 PM so plan your journey accordingly (I recommended getting a AC Volvo).
Another good option is Zingbus although I much prefer HRTC as once a Zingbus driver forgot to stop at a stop and refused to come back to pick us up (not all are bad, but just my experience).

__Warning: There will be many people offering good deals outside ISBT for private buses, do not take them. Last time I missed my HRTC bus and had to take a private bus and it was the worst bus journey of my life (It was called northern buses or something). The bus was full of loud and aggressive drunk people, they were doing drugs and refused a refund. I had no choice so I travelled, never doing it again.__

### 2. ISBT Kasmere gate
Delhi metro is well connected and you can easily reach the **Kasmere gate** metro station using that.
Once you reach the station take an exit at **Gate 7** to reach **ISBT Kasmere gate**.

## Option 2: Via Chandigarh

### 1. Which bus to book?
From Chandigarh to Mandi there you can book any government bus (HRTC, PUNBUS, etc. all are good).
The Journey is relatively short (appx. 5-6 hrs) so I usually book a non-volvo bus (not the ordinary one but the one that has charging, not sure what they are called).
There are usually frequent buses in this route so I don't usually book ahead and simply go to the bus stop and buy ticket.
Personally, just be be safe I still recommend HRTC, you can book the tickets online using [HRTC Official Website](https://www.hrtchp.com/hrtc_info/).

**Note: Carry cash with you if you are planning to buy tickets offline, they don't usually accept UPI.**

### 2. ISBT Sector-43
You need to get to **ISBT Sector-43** to take buses towards Himachal. 
Don't get confused to and go to **Sector-17** as its only for local buses toward Punjab.
It's always a good idea to ask people for help and especially in Chandigarh which is a beautiful place with beautiful people.

### 3. Getting to campus from Mandi
College bus is the easiest to reach the campus but if you are a new student and don't yet have option to book a bus from Mandi to the campus, there are two good options.

1. (Recommended) if you have luggage:
You can easily find a cab outside the bus stop to the campus.
The price will be very high (~Rs 900 currently) so its better to have a travel partner to split the bill.
If you are not able to find anyone you can contact a local cab service (I prefer **Him White Cabs** (You can ask for Naresh/Manish 09418156918) and have gone to many trips with them, you can tell them about my blog if you choose to travel with them :)).

2. If you don't have much luggage (just one backpack or so):
You can take a local bus (there are no fancy ones sadly) from ISBT Mandi that goes to **Kamand**.
If you are going to **South Campus** take a ticket for **Kamand** (South Campus is also called as IIT Kamand Campus).
If you are going to **North Campus** take a ticket for **Salgi** (It the village right outside the North Campus, Also this is the road that goes to Kullu Manali ;)).
This is a busy route and the bus will be fully packed most of the times. 
The journey however is around 30-40 mins, and just costs Rs.25 compared to more than 30X for the cab.
I personally prefer this option when I don't have much luggage.

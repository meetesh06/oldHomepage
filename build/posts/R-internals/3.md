[R Melts Brain - research paper of concern](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3359619.3359744)

This is the parent post and mostly intended to be a starting
point to this lineage, as there is progress in this topic I will
be posting subsequent posts that are meant to follow this.

Some things that are surely to be posted are
- R's handling of environments and its implications
- Challenges in R's static analysis
- Intermediate language's for R
- etc... as life goes on

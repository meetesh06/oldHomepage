[GenericGithubBlog ](https://github.com/meetesh06/GenericGithubBlog)


This is the parent post and mostly intended to be a starting
point to this lineage, as there is progress in this topic I will
be posting subsequent posts that are meant to follow this.

Some things that are surely to be posted are
- Implementing proper state handling in this blog
- why does the blog works fine even with so many redundancy problems
- why code better even when the server will prolly cache ;P
- etc... as life goes on

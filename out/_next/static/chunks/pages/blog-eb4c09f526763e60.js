Which bus to book?\\nMy only recommended bus service on this route is the government run HRTC buses, you can book the tickets online using [HRTC Official Website](https://www.hrtchp.com/hrtc_info/).\\nThe bus starts in the evening (around 7PM) and the last bus is at 9:50 PM so plan your journey accordingly (I recommended getting a AC Volvo).\\nAnother good option is Zingbus although I much prefer HRTC as once a Zingbus driver forgot to stop at a stop and refused to come back to pick us up (not all are bad, but just my experience).\\n\\n__Warning: There will be many people offering good deals outside ISBT for private buses, do not take them. Last time I missed my HRTC bus and had to take a private bus and it was the worst bus journey of my life (It was called northern buses or something). The bus was full of loud and aggressive drunk people, they were doing drugs and refused a refund. I had no choice so I travelled, never doing it again.__\\n\\n### 2. ISBT Kasmere gate\\nDelhi metro is well connected and you can easily reach the **Kasmere gate** metro station using that.\\nOnce you reach the station take an exit at **Gate 7** to reach **ISBT Kasmere gate**. \\n\\n***\\n\\n## Option 2: Via Chandigarh\\n\\n### 1. Which bus to book?\\nFrom Chandigarh to Mandi there you can book any government bus (HRTC, PUNBUS, etc. all are good).\\nThe Journey is relatively short (appx. 5-6 hrs) so I usually book a non-volvo bus (not the ordinary one but the one that has charging, not sure what they are called).\\nThere are usually frequent buses in this route so I don\'t usually book ahead and simply go to the bus stop and buy ticket.\\nPersonally, just be be safe I still recommend HRTC, you can book the tickets online using [HRTC Official Website](https://www.hrtchp.com/hrtc_info/).\\n\\n**Note: Carry cash with you if you are planning to buy tickets offline, they don\'t usually accept UPI.**\\n\\n### 2. ISBT Sector-43\\nYou need to get to **ISBT Sector-43** to take buses towards Himachal. \\nDon\'t get confused to and go to **Sector-17** as its only for local buses toward Punjab.\\nIt\'s always a good idea to ask people for help and especially in Chandigarh which is a beautiful place with beautiful people. \\n\\n***\\n\\n### 3. Getting to campus from Mandi\\nCollege bus is the easiest to reach the campus but if you are a new student and don\'t yet have option to book a bus from Mandi to the campus, there are two good options.\\n\\n1. (Recommended) if you have luggage:\\nYou can easily find a cab outside the bus stop to the campus.\\nThe price will be very high (~Rs 900 currently) so its better to have a travel partner to split the bill.\\nIf you are not able to find anyone you can contact a local cab service (I prefer **Him White Cabs** (You can ask for Naresh/Manish 09418156918) and have gone to many trips with them, you can tell them about my blog if you choose to travel with them :)).\\n\\n2. If you don\'t have much luggage (just one backpack or so):\\nYou can take a local bus (there are no fancy ones sadly) from ISBT Mandi that goes to **Kamand**.\\nIf you are going to **South Campus** take a ticket for **Kamand** (South Campus is also called as IIT Kamand Campus).\\nIf you are going to **North Campus** take a ticket for **Salgi** (It the village right outside the North Campus, Also this is the road that goes to Kullu Manali ;)).\\nThis is a busy route and the bus will be fully packed most of the times. \\nThe journey however is around 30-40 mins, and just costs Rs.25 compared to more than 30X for the cab.\\nI personally prefer this option when I don\'t have much luggage.\\n\\n","backup":""},{"id":2,"category":"IIT Mandi","lineage":"Proxy around campus","title":"Logging into proxy over the terminal","description":"Short post on logging into proxy.","created":"24-01-2023","link":"IIT Mandi/remotelogin.md","postText":"\\n\u200b\\n1.

People with familiarity in the subject might point out the \\nincompleteness of this explanation, but thats okay.\\nWith that out of the way, lets start with an example that I think encapsualtes the essence and \\ngreater meaning multiple dispatch provides while being extremely obvious all along.\\n\\n#### Imagine a situation where you are asked to design a game in Java with the following specification\\n\\n  1. A room that accomodates various types people _(Husband, Wife, Maid, etc...)_.\\n  2. The room can contain objects with which the people can interact with.\\n  \\n\\n> The husband is a pianist and plays the **piano**, the maid\'s job is to keep the piano clean and wife \\n> just regrets marrying a musician every time she sees the piano.\\n> Similarly, when the husband comes across the **fridge** he pours himself a drink, the maid restocks the \\n> fridge and the wife checks the fride and updates her grocery list.\\n> The husband ignores __any other object__, wife draws its sketch, maid looks in awe.\\n\\n__Problem Statement__ : Imagine this is a game you are developing, the user might be any of the following \\ntype of person and might interact with any kind of an object. You do not know what kind of person the user has actually picked, write code to ensure that the right action gets executed. \\n\\n\\n__A base class of person__\\n\\n```java\\ninterface Person {\\n  // Some common properties like name, etc.\\n}\\n\\n// For sake of simplicity let us first consider the husband only\\nclass Husband implements Person {\\n  public void interact(EnvObj a) { \\n    System.out.println(\\"ignore\\");\\n  }\\n  public void interact(Piano a) {\\n    System.out.println(\\"Play\\"); \\n  }\\n  public void interact(Fridge a) {\\n    System.out.println(\\"ignore\\"); \\n  }\\n  // ...\\n}\\n// ... similarly for other characters\\n```\\n__Defining the environment objects__\\n\\n```java\\n// Objects On Scene\\nclass EnvObject {\\n  // Some common properties like mass, acceleration, etc.\\n}\\nclass Piano extends EnvObject {\\n}\\nclass Fridge extends EnvObject {\\n}\\n// ... similarly for other objects\\n```\\n\\n__The interaction method when a person encounters an environment object__\\n\\n1. __This is wrong because of multiple dispatch__ \\n``` java\\n  public void encounters(Person p, EnvObject o) {\\n    p.interact(o); // always prints ignore ?? why ??\\n  }\\n```\\nThe code always prints __ignore__\\n\\nThe environment objects runtime type can be anything _(Fridge, Piano, etc...)_, but when calling the interact method we only \\nlook at the runtime type of Person _(which can be __Husband,Wife,etc...__)_ but the runtime type of the __EnvObject__ is not decoded.\\n\\n__This is because of single dispatch that Java supports.__\\n\\n2. __An alternative approach (using instance of)__ \\n``` java\\n  public void encounters(Person p, EnvObject o) {\\n    if (o instance of Piano) {\\n      Piano obj = (Piano) o;\\n      p.interact(obj);\\n    } else {\\n      p.interact(o);\\n    }\\n  }\\n```\\n\\nIn this approach we explicitly do typecasting which is a very inefficient way to solve this problem.\\n\\nAnother major drawback of this approach is the amount of code we might need to add if say we added,\\na new object into this world called **burger**.\\nWhat do you do when you see a burger, you eat it.\\nBut in our code, we have to individually define the action of eating a burger in each and every one of \\nthe class. ughh... what a drag.\\n\\nWhat if we could define something that says,\\n\\n```\\n(Person, Burger) - interact -> \\"just eat it.\\"\\n```\\nIn doing so we come across a scenario of unquestionable uncertainity,\\n```\\n(Husband, EnvObject) -> \\"ignore\\"\\n\\n(Person, Burger) -> \\"Eat it\\"\\n```\\nBoth of there definitions are correct in their own regard, but which is __more correct__ is obvious.\\n\\nTo understand it in simple terms, it is like asking a man with his eyes closed to tell color of the \\ncrayons in his hand. There may exist many solutions to this problem, but the simplest is to open his eyes.\\n\\nOne interesting solution that I must follow this post with is the visitor pattern, \\nGiven two generic object types, we ensure that relevant method of theiry interaction is called without explicitly defining so.\\n\\n### SOURCES\\n\\n__source 1__: [wiki.c2 article on Multiple Dispatch](https://wiki.c2.com/?MultipleDispatch)\\n\\n__source 2__: [Prototypes with Multiple Dispatch: An Expressive and Dynamic Object Model](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~aldrich/papers/ecoop05pmd.pdf)\\n","backup":""},{"id":4,"category":"Programming","lineage":"Dispatch","title":"The Visitor Pattern","description":"An in-depth video about the visitor pattern","created":"09-12-2021","link":"Programming/5-visitorPattern.md","postText":"\\nVisitor pattern tries to create a system of double dispatch in languages that support \\nsingle dispatch.\\n\\nAs we saw in the previous post, it is very tricky and expensive to handle such systems without \\nruntime typechecks __(instanceof)__.

Setting up Docker was a pain, thanks to Arjun for helping me dubug this :)

1. First and foremost install docker.
```
sudo apt install docker.io 
```
2. Set user group to docker (so that we can used docker without sudo)
```
sudo groupadd docker
sudo usermod -aG docker $USER 
```
​
3. Restart the computer for the user group changes to take place
```
groups
```
​
This should now list the groups the user belongs to, docker should be one of them.
​
4. Setting up proxy, using systemd
​
```
# create the directory for docker systemd service
sudo mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d
sudo touch /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/http-proxy.conf
```
​
5. Edit the http-proxy.conf
​
```
sudo gedit /etc/systemd/system/docker.service.d/http-proxy.conf
```
​
Paste the following into the file, make sure to fill in the username and password.
​
```
[Service]
Environment="HTTP_PROXY=http://<username>:<password>@gateway.iitmandi.ac.in:8080"
Environment="HTTPS_PROXY=http://<username>:<password>@gateway.iitmandi.ac.in:8080"
Environment="NO_PROXY=localhost,127.0.0.1"
```
​
6. Restart the docker daemon
​
```
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl restart docker
```
​
7. Verify that proxy is working by pulling some image
​
```
docker pull ubuntu:20.04
```

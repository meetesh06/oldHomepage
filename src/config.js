I'm a research scholar @IIT Mandi working in the area of compilers.My latest work focuses on a JIT compiler for the R Programming Language where I tackle the problems of warmup times and deoptimization overheads. I also love to code in React, like this website. Apart from computers I also tinker a lot with Raspberry Pi's, Arduinos, etc in my free time.";
